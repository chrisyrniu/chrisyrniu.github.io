Hi! I am a PhD student at [CMU Safe AI Lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html). Previously, I received an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), working with [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). Before that, I received a B.E. in Intelligence Science and Technology at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). I also spent wonderful time as a research intern at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) with [Dr. Liangjun Zhang](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~zlj/), and at [Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/).

My research goal is to build methodologies for collaborative, interpretable, and reliable intelligent robotic systems that can interact with complex environments (including humans) around them. Thus, my research interest lies at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, and their applications in multi-agent coordination, autonomous driving, and human-robot interaction. 

My Chinese name is 牛雅儒 (Niu-Ya-Ru), where my first name (雅儒) can be interpreted as a scholar in elegant taste by [ancient Chinese](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E9%9B%85%E5%84%92/5817490).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
